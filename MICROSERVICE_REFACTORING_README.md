# AI Fusion Core - Microservice Architecture Refactoring

## Overview

This document outlines the refactoring work completed to transform the existing Python backend into a proper microservice architecture using FastAPI. The refactoring focuses on improving service communication, configuration management, and operational monitoring while maintaining backward compatibility.

## What Was Refactored

### 1. API Gateway (main.py) Improvements

#### **Enhanced Service Discovery**
- **Before**: Hardcoded service configuration in a dictionary
- **After**: Environment-based configuration with proper service registry

#### **Service Registry with Health Monitoring**
- **Before**: Basic health checks without state tracking
- **After**: Comprehensive service registry with circuit breaker pattern

#### **Proper Service Communication**
- **Before**: Pass-through routing (route_to_service just called next)
- **After**: Intelligent request routing with error handling

### 2. Centralized Configuration Management

Created `proto_common/service_config.py` for centralized configuration with:
- Environment variable support for all services
- JSON serialization for persistence
- Required vs optional service classification
- Centralized service discovery

### 3. Enhanced Monitoring and Debugging

#### **Service Registry API Endpoints**
- `/api/v2/services/registry` - Get detailed service registry
- `/api/v2/services/{service}/health-check` - Manual health check

#### **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
- Automatic service health monitoring
- Failure threshold tracking
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

## Architecture Improvements

### **Service Communication Patterns**
1. **Request Routing**: Intelligent routing based on URL patterns
2. **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error responses
3. **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts for service calls
4. **Circuit Breaker**: Automatic failure detection and recovery

### **Configuration Management**
1. **Environment Variables**: All service configurations can be overridden
2. **Service Registry**: Centralized service information with health status
3. **Required Services**: Classification of critical vs optional services
4. **Persistence**: Configuration can be saved/loaded from JSON files

## Migration Steps

### **For Existing Deployments**
1. **No Breaking Changes**: Maintains backward compatibility
2. **Optional Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   export AI_KERNEL_HOST=ai-kernel-service
   export AI_KERNEL_GRPC_PORT=50051
   export AI_KERNEL_HTTP_PORT=8001
   ```

### **For New Deployments**
1. **Use existing Docker Compose**: Already supports new architecture
2. **Set production environment variables** for infrastructure services

## Benefits Achieved

### **Operational Benefits**
- Better Service Discovery with environment-based configuration
- Health Monitoring with real-time status tracking
- Graceful Degradation when optional services fail
- Debugging Support with rich monitoring APIs

### **Development Benefits**
- Environment Flexibility for different deployment environments
- Service Isolation with clear separation of concerns
- Scalability foundation for horizontal scaling
- Maintainability with centralized configuration

### **Production Benefits**
- Circuit Breaker Pattern prevents cascade failures
- Proper Timeout Handling for slow services
- Clear Error Propagation with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Rich Metrics for operational dashboards

## API Changes

### **New Endpoints**
| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/v2/services/registry` | GET | Get detailed service registry |
| `/api/v2/services/{service}/health-check` | POST | Manual health check |

### **Enhanced Existing Endpoints**
- `/health`: Now includes detailed service status information
- `/api/v1/info`: Includes microservice status and configuration

## Configuration Options

### **Service Configuration**
Each service can be configured via environment variables:
```bash
AI_KERNEL_HOST=localhost
AI_KERNEL_GRPC_PORT=50051
AI_KERNEL_HTTP_PORT=8001
```

### **Infrastructure Configuration**
```bash
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
REDIS_HOST=localhost
VECTOR_DB_HOST=localhost
```

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**
1. **Service Connection Failures**:
   - Check: `GET /api/v2/services/registry`
   - Verify environment variables
   - Manual health check: `POST /api/v2/services/{service}/health-check`

2. **Configuration Issues**:
   - Validate environment variables
   - Check service discovery settings

## Conclusion

The refactoring successfully transforms the backend into a robust microservice architecture with:

✅ **Proper service discovery and configuration management**
✅ **Intelligent request routing with error handling**
✅ **Circuit breaker pattern for resilience**
✅ **Comprehensive health monitoring and debugging**
✅ **Environment-based configuration for flexibility**
✅ **Backward compatibility with existing APIs**
✅ **Foundation for AI Kernel integration and scaling**

The architecture now fully supports the upcoming AI Kernel integration and provides a solid foundation for production deployment and scaling.
